## Project Information for V2 of Pi4J with Addon-board Extensions

Java I/O library that extends and fixes [pi4j](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-v2). Following extensions have been implemented:

* Framework for better support of Raspberry Pi expansion board projects
* LinuxFS digital output GPIO

See [Servo PWM Pi](https://github.com/rdratlos/pi4j-plugin-servopwmpi) for an example project that uses this library to control the Servo PWM Pi Raspberry Pi expansion board from https://www.abelectronics.co.uk.


## Project Information for V2 of Pi4J

Project website: [pi4j.com](https://pi4j.com/).

This project is intended to provide a **friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java Programmers** to access the **full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform**. This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to **focus on implementing their application business logic**.

## Using Pi4J

When you want to use Pi4J in your project, you should definitely check out [the Pi4J website](https://pi4j.com) where you can find a lot of information and many examples! 

For example, for a minimal example to blink a LED ([fully explained here](https://pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application/)), you need to import the dependencies and use this code:

```java
var pi4j = Pi4J.newAutoContext();

var led = pi4j.digitalOutput().create(PIN_LED);

while (true) {
  if (led.state() == DigitalState.HIGH) {
    led.low();
  } else {
    led.high();
  }
  Thread.sleep(500);
}
```

### Project Overview

Starting with the Pi4J 2.0 builds, the Pi4J project is prioritizing focus
on providing Java programs access, control and communication with the core
I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform.

Read all about it on [pi4j.com: "Whatâ€™s New in 2.0?"](https://pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2/).

### Build Instructions

The Pi4J V2 codebase can be built using [Apache Maven 3.6.x](https://maven.apache.org/). and [Java JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net/).
The following command can be used to build the Pi4J V2 JARs:

```
mvn clean install
```

Pi4J V2 also includes native libraries that will need to be compiled if you are modifying any native code.
Most users will never need to compile the native libraries as these artifacts are automatically downloaded  
when building the Pi4J JARs from Maven repositories. One of the following commands can be used to build 
the Pi4J V2 JARs and Native Libraries:

```
mvn clean install -Pnative
mvn clean install -Pnative,docker
```

> **NOTE:** A comprehensive set of build instructions can be found in the [Pi4J V2 Documentation](https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/build-instructions/).

### Adding a feature or solving a problem

If you have and idea to extend and improve Pi4J, please first create a ticket to discuss how 
it fits in the project and how it can be implemented. 

If you find a bug, create a ticket, so we are aware of it and others with the same problem can 
contribute what they already investigated. And the quickest way to get a fix? Try to search for 
the cause of the problem or even better provide a code fix!
